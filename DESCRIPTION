Description: The package provides functions for a semi-automated approach of
    the delineation and description of landscape units and partition into
    terrain components. It can be used for the pre-processing of
    semi-distributed large-scale hydrological and erosion models using catena-representation (WASA-SED, CATFLOW). It is closely
    connected to and uses functionalities of GRASS GIS. Additional pre-processing tools beyond the scope of the original LUMP are included.
